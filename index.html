      <h2>My Story</h2>
      <p>
        I was born and raised in Bronx, NY in a Jamaican-American household. Since a kid, ive always been very self sufficient and inquisitive with a genuine love for math and technology. In fact I was able to complete ALL of my math courses for college prior to graduating high school. I attended VCU, Virginia Commonwealth University and majored in Biology on a pre dental track. A persons smile was always my favorite feature, So I figured why not be a dentist Im smart enough and I like smiles. Not realizing that that logic wasn't a good enough reasoning to base my entire future on without knowing the complete requirements to actually achieve that career. Like most I felt inclined to quickly decide my major in order to avoid "waisting time", before I truly explored my options. Unfortunately there weren't too many career opportunities available with solely a BA in biology, I needed to continue my education further. Had I taken the time to explore my options I would have discovered my true passion sooner, which is coding. Coding and computer programming are the final products if math and technology were to have a baby. I have always idolized coders and hackers from tv shows like Criminal Minds, I just didn't know where to start to even attempt a career in coding. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2021, I was blessed with a beautiful baby girl. My due date was April 20th, 2021, but ended up going into labor on February 5th. I only made it two weeks into my 3rd trimester due to Pre-eclampsia. My london was born 2 pounds even at 27 weeks gestation via emergency C-section. The anesthesiologist caused a spinal fluid leak when attempting to give me the spinal tap which prevented me from being able to walk let alone hold up my head for entire 7 days. The doctors were in denial of the cause and waited six days before they attempted to fix the issue with two blood patches injected into my spin. London spent 65 days in the NICU, contracted covid and was forced to transfer hospitals to a PICU for 14 days prior to coming home. Her father wasnt supportive nor present so I went through the process alone. I began dating again and reconnected with the love of my life. This was the happiest I had been in years. He respected and loved me and my daughter unconditionally. Even though he wasnâ€™t her biological father, he treated her as if she were his own. On September 9th, 2021 my Child's father forced his way into our new home and murdered the love of my life right in front of my daughter who was only 7 months old at the time.  With such a traumatic turn of events, me and my daughter were forced to move back home for our safety. I was fortunate enough to have a family cape-able of taking us in and supporting us financially, allowing me time to get back on my feet. 
      </p>
      <p>
       My uncle informed me about the IT programs offered through Generation USA that were both virtual and free. This was the perfect opportunity for me to continue my education in an area that I was genuinely interested in. I enrolled into generation USA fullstack Java Script Developer program to begin my coding career. My expected completion date is March 7th, 2022. Stay tuned to see where my career takes me.
